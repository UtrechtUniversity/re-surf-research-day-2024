# Low-barrier access to cloud computing on ResearchCloud {data-background-color="#FFCD00"}

::: {.r-stack}
a case study
:::

::: {.footer}
:::

## Introduction
::: {.theme-section}

Research Data Management Services @ Utrecht University:

- Research IT & Engineering
- Yoda
- Applications (GitHub)
- &rarr; HPC support & access

:::

## Introduction
::: {.theme-section}

- Large increase in demand for HPC.
- No longer just for clusters, but also for Virtual Research Environments (VRE)!
- At UU, we meet this demand using SURF services:
    - Snellius
    - ResearchCloud (VRE)
    - RCCS contracts

:::

## Research Capacity Computing Service
::: {.theme-section}

<br>

RCCS gives institutes direct access to SURFs compute facilities:

<br>

- Lowering barriers 
- Snellius & SURF Research Cloud
- Expertise 
- pay-per-use model


:::

## Research Capacity Computing Service
::: {.theme-section}

Costs:

- 1.000 RCCS-credits - 33,14 euro
- ~0,03 euro per CPU hour on Research Cloud
- ~0,025 euro per CPU hour on Snellius
- Access to commercial cloud (varying cost)

:::

## How do we organize access?

![](images/website.png){width=80%}

- Intake with engineer (30 minutes)
- Starting budget of 10.000 credits


## How do we organize access?
::: {.theme-section}

Intake meeting:

* 30 minutes
* Check code and compute requirements
* Advice on platform
* Request account
:::

## Support

::: {.theme-section}

Support provided by Research Engineers:

- Getting started workshop (SRC)
- Catalog development (SRC)
- Basic user support (Snellius and SRC)
- Weekly walk-in hours
:::

## History
::: {.theme-section}
:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width=50%}
- RCCS @ UU runs for ~8 years (Kees van Eijden)
- From ~10 users to >100 users (1 every 2 months to 5 per week (peak))

## What do we learn from this?

- Large demand for flexible HPC solutions at small-medium (VRE) as well as large (Snellius) scale.
- RCSS starting budgets help researchers to conduct exploratory studies, often leading to larger projects.

## What do we learn from this?

Success factors at UU:

- Low-barrier signup
- Low-barrier user support
- Hands-on engineering support
- Good relations with IT groups at faculties

Most importantly:

- Dedicated team of engineers, developers, admins (~TODO number of people/fte?)

## Future challenges

Challenges when scaling up further:

- Ensuring enough user support and intake capacity, together with faculties
- Billing recurring large users internally
